### Description:
This repository contains info about Design Patterns Fundamentals and their Implementation in Java Programming Language.<br/>
All code is implemented using Java with Steps and Comments included inside the source classes.<br/>



### Technologies:
- Programming Language: Java SE API
- Development IDE: Eclipse IDE
- Packaging and Building: Apache Maven
- Testing Environment: JUnit 5 Jupiter



### Concepts Behind Design Patterns:
Software Engineers need design patterns as tools to build professional Software.<br/>
Design Patterns are the rules and "Way of Thinking" that govern Software Creation and Development.<br/>
Design Patterns are strategies that help make the code maintainable, reliable, robust and flexible for future upgrades.<br/>
Design Patterns are descriptions or templates of solutions that can be used in many different situations.<br/>
In 1995, the "Gang of Four" Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides came up with the 23 basic Design Patterns.<br/>

### Advantages of Design Patterns:
- Reuse existing, high-quality solutions to commonly recurring problems.
- Establish common terminology of Software Design to improve communications within teams.
- Shift the level of thinking to a higher perspective.
- Decide whether we have the right design, not just one that works.
- Improve individual learning and team learning.
- Improve the modifiability and and maintainability of code.
- Discover design alternatives to inheritance hierarchies.
- Support object-oriented principles: Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism.

### Creational Design Patterns: 
These design patterns are all about class instantiation and object creation.<br/> 
They abstract the instantiation process by encapsulating the concrete classes.<br/>
Creational Design Patterns Types:<br/>
- [Factory Method Design Pattern.](/src/main/java/creationalDesignPatterns/factoryMethodDesignPattern/FactoryMethodDesignPattern.md)
- [Abstract Factory Design Pattern.](/src/main/java/creationalDesignPatterns/abstractFactoryDesignPattern/AbstractFactoryDesignPattern.md)
- [Builder Design Pattern.](/src/main/java/creationalDesignPatterns/builderDesignPattern/BuilderDesignPattern.md)													
- [Prototype Design Pattern.](/src/main/java/creationalDesignPatterns/prototypeDesignPattern/PrototypeDesignPattern.md)													
- [Singleton Design Pattern.](/src/main/java/creationalDesignPatterns/singletonDesignPattern/SingletonDesignPattern.md)
- [Object Pool Design Pattern.](/src/main/java/creationalDesignPatterns/objectPoolDesignPattern/ObjectPoolDesignPattern.md)

### Structural Design Patterns:
These design patterns are all about Class and Object composition and combination to form complex structures.<br/> 
Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces.<br/> 
Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.<br/>
Structural Design Patterns Types:<br/>
- [Adapter Design Pattern.](/src/main/java/structuralDesignPatterns/adapterDesignPattern/AdapterDesignPattern.md)
- [Bridge Design Pattern.](/src/main/java/structuralDesignPatterns/bridgeDesignPattern/BridgeDesignPattern.md)
- [Composite Design Pattern.](/src/main/java/structuralDesignPatterns/compositeDesignPattern/CompositeDesignPattern.md)
- [Decorator Design Pattern.](/src/main/java/structuralDesignPatterns/decoratorDesignPattern/DecoratorDesignPattern.md)															
- [Facade Design Pattern.](/src/main/java/structuralDesignPatterns/facadeDesignPattern/FacadeDesignPattern.md) 
- [Flyweight Design Pattern.](/src/main/java/structuralDesignPatterns/flyweightDesignPattern/FlyweightDesignPattern.md)
- [Private Class Data Design Pattern.](/src/main/java/structuralDesignPatterns/privateClassDataDesignPattern/PrivateClassDataDesignPattern.md)
- [Proxy Design Pattern.](/src/main/java/structuralDesignPatterns/proxyDesignPattern/ProxyDesignPattern.md)

### Behavioral Design Patterns:
These design patterns are all about Class's objects communication.<br/>  
Behavioral patterns are those patterns that are most specifically concerned with communication between objects.<br/>
Behavioral patterns use inheritance to describe algorithms and flow of control.<br/>
Behavioral Design Patterns Types:<br/>
- [Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern.](/src/main/java/behavioralDesignPatterns/chainOfResponsibilityDesignPattern/ChainOfResponsibilityDesignPattern.md)
- [Command Design Pattern.](/src/main/java/behavioralDesignPatterns/commandDesignPattern/CommandDesignPattern.md)									
- [Interpreter Design Pattern.](/src/main/java/behavioralDesignPatterns/interpreterDesignPattern/InterpreterDesignPattern.md)
- [Iterator Design Pattern.](/src/main/java/behavioralDesignPatterns/iteratorDesignPattern/IteratorDesignPattern.md)
- [Mediator Design Pattern.](/src/main/java/behavioralDesignPatterns/mediatorDesignPattern/MediatorDesignPattern.md)										
- [Memento Design Pattern.](/src/main/java/behavioralDesignPatterns/mementoDesignPattern/MementoDesignPattern.md)													
- [Null Object Method Design Pattern.](/src/main/java/behavioralDesignPatterns/nullObjectDesignPattern/NullObjectDesignPattern.md)
- [Observer Design Pattern.](/src/main/java/behavioralDesignPatterns/observerDesignPattern/ObserverDesignPattern.md)																		
- [State Design Pattern.](/src/main/java/behavioralDesignPatterns/stateDesignPattern/StateDesignPattern.md) 
- [Strategy Design Pattern.](/src/main/java/behavioralDesignPatterns/strategyDesignPattern/StrategyDesignPattern.md)						 
- [Template Method Design Pattern.](/src/main/java/behavioralDesignPatterns/templateMethodDesignPattern/TemplateMethodDesignPattern.md) 
- [Visitor Method Design Pattern.](/src/main/java/behavioralDesignPatterns/visitorDesignPattern/VisitorDesignPattern.md)
