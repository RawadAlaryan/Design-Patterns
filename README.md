### Description:
This repository contains info about Design Patterns Fundamentals and their Implementation in Java Programming Language.<br/>
All code is implemented using Java with Steps and Comments included inside the source classes.<br/>



### Technologies:
- Programming Language: Java SE API
- Development IDE: Eclipse IDE
- Packaging and Building: Apache Maven
- Testing Environment: JUnit 5 Jupiter



### Concepts Behind Design Patterns:
Software Engineers need design patterns as tools to build professional Software.<br/>
Design Patterns are the rules and "Way of Thinking" that govern Software Creation and Development.<br/>
Design Patterns are strategies that help make the code maintainable, reliable, robust and flexible for future upgrades.<br/>
Design Patterns are descriptions or templates of solutions that can be used in many different situations.<br/>
In 1995, the "Gang of Four" Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides came up with the 23 basic Design Patterns.<br/>

### Advantages of Design Patterns:
- Reuse existing, high-quality solutions to commonly recurring problems.
- Establish common terminology of Software Design to improve communications within teams.
- Shift the level of thinking to a higher perspective.
- Decide whether we have the right design, not just one that works.
- Improve individual learning and team learning.
- Improve the modifiability and and maintainability of code.
- Discover design alternatives to inheritance hierarchies.
- Support object-oriented principles: Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism.

2. Structural Design Patterns.
3. Behavioral Design Patterns.

### Creational Design Patterns: 
These design patterns are all about class instantiation and object creation.<br/> 
They abstract the instantiation process by encapsulating the concrete classes.<br/>
Creational Design Patterns Types:<br/>
- [Factory Method Design Pattern.](/src/main/java/creationalDesignPatterns/factoryMethodDesignPattern/FactoryMethodDesignPattern.md)
- [Abstract Factory Design Pattern.](/src/main/java/creationalDesignPatterns/abstractFactoryDesignPattern/AbstractFactoryDesignPattern.md)
- [Builder Design Pattern.](/src/main/java/creationalDesignPatterns/builderDesignPattern/BuilderDesignPattern.md)													
- [Prototype Design Pattern.](/src/main/java/creationalDesignPatterns/prototypeDesignPattern/PrototypeDesignPattern.md)													
- [Singleton Design Pattern.](/src/main/java/creationalDesignPatterns/singletonDesignPattern/SingletonDesignPattern.md)
- [Object Pool Design Pattern.](/src/main/java/creationalDesignPatterns/objectPoolDesignPattern/ObjectPoolDesignPattern.md)

### Structural Design Patterns:
These design patterns are all about Class and Object composition and combination to form complex structures.<br/> 
Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces.<br/> 
Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.<br/>
Structural Design Patterns Types:<br/>
- Adapter Design Pattern.
- Bridge Design Pattern.
- Composite Design Pattern.															
- Decorator Design Pattern. 
- Facade Design Pattern. 														
- Flyweight Design Pattern.														
- Private Class Data Design Pattern.
- Proxy Design Pattern.

### Behavioral Design Patterns:
These design patterns are all about Class's objects communication.<br/>  
Behavioral patterns are those patterns that are most specifically concerned with communication between objects.<br/>
Behavioral patterns use inheritance to describe algorithms and flow of control.<br/>
Behavioral Design Patterns Types:<br/>
- Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern.									
- Command Design Pattern. 
- Interpreter Design Pattern.												
- Iterator Design Pattern.										
- Mediator Design Pattern.															
- Memento Design Pattern.																		
- Observer Design Pattern. 
- State Design Pattern.						 
- Strategy Design Pattern. 
- Template Method Design Pattern. 							
- Visitor Design Pattern.			
- Null Object Design Pattern.
