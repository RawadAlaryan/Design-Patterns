/**
Private Class Data Design Pattern:
	It is a Structural Design Pattern.
	It restricts accessor/mutator access.
	It controls write-access to class attributes by separating data from methods that use it.
	It encapsulates class data initialization by providing new type of final - final after constructor.
	
	In Private Class Data Design Pattern, we have the following elements:
		1. MainClass.
		2. DataClass.
