/**
Iterator Design Pattern:
	It is a Behavioral Design Pattern.
	It traverses/iterates a container and access the container's elements. sequentially.
	It provides a way to access the elements/objects of an aggregate Collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
		An aggregate object (also called a container or a collection) is an object that contains other objects for the purpose of grouping those objects as a unit; such as LinkedLists and Hashtables.
	Iterator Design Pattern can work together with the Visitor Design Pattern that applies an operation to each element in the aggregate object.
	Java JDK has an Iterator Interface in package: 			java.util.Iterator.
	
	In Iterator Design Pattern, we have the following elements:
		1. Iterator: (Interface and Concrete) for accessing and traversing elements.
		2. Aggregate or Container: (Interface and Concrete) defines an interface for creating an iterator object.
		3. Client.
