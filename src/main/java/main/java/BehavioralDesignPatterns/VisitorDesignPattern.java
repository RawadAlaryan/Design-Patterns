Visitor Design Pattern:
	It is a Behavioral Design Pattern.
	It defines an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure (collection, list etc.) without change to the class.
	The classic technique for recovering lost type information.
	
	In Visitor Design Pattern, we have the following elements:
		1. Visitor:		Declares the visit(visitable) operations for the visitable classes
							The operations name and signature identifies the class thats sends the Visit request to the visitor. 
		2. Visitable:		Implements the Visitor methods.
		3. Element:		Defines the accept(visitor) method that takes a visitor as an argument.
