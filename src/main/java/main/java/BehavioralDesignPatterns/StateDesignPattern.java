/**
State Design Pattern:
	It is a Behavioral Design Pattern.
	It alters an object's behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.
	It used in designing an object-oriented finite state machine FSM, Traffic Signals.
	
	In State Design Pattern, we have the following elements:
		1. State: An abstract Class or an Interface for declaring the minimum expected functionality for each Concrete State Object.
		2. ConcreteState: Implementation Classes for the State.
		3. Context: A Class  for maintaining the current state instance. It also delegates the responsibility to the concrete state classes to perform a task.
